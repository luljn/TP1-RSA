# Project description.

The TP aims to illustrate the deployment of a set of cryptographic mechanisms to secure
the exchange between two parties: Alice and Bob. The TP considers a message sent from Bob to Alice, where
each has a key pair (public, private) for RSA encryption. Bob encrypts the message
with Alice's public key. It also signs the digital fingerprint of the message with
his private key. Alice receives the message decrypts it and verifies Bob's signature.
